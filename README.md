Yeoman BaseKit Template Generator
=================================

## What is this?

A bare bones version template that can be setup with the power of [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/).

## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Yeoman helps you to kickstart new projects, prescribing best practices and tools to help you stay productive.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. You can install it by doing the following:

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Installation

To install generator-basekit-template from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-basekit-template
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
yo generator basekit template
```

Now you should have a folder containing everything you'll need to create your own BaseKit template.
